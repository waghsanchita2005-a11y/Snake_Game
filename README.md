# Classic Snake Game

A modern implementation of the classic Snake game, the recreation of the retro mechanics and aesthetics of the iconic mobile version. This project serves as a showcase of fundamental game development principles, including core logic implementation, state management, and user interface design.

# Project Overview and Technical Focus

This application successfully replicates the simple, yet addictive, gameplay loop of the original Snake game, demonstrating:

* Robust Game Logic: Implementation of continuous snake movement, dynamic snake growth upon consuming food, and precise collision detection (self-collision and boundary hits).
* State Management:  Effective handling and updating of critical game variables, including the player score and snake coordinates.
* Retro Aesthetics: Utilization of a minimal, grid-based rendering style to capture the nostalgic, monochrome feel of the early 2000s mobile experience.
